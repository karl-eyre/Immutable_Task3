Happy Path Tests:

Scenario: when reward provided, user reward balance increased by reward amount. 

Test: When the reward is provided, expect that the users reward balance equals current balance plus daily reward value.

Scenario: On application startup if daily reward has been received, do nothing.

Test: On application startup if reward has previously been received that day check balance at startup time equals current balance.

Edge Case Tests:

Scenario: User changes date on device to try and receive multiple rewards, expect no additional reward provided.

Test: when reward function runs check that the date used to check for a new day is equal to UTC time & date, if so test passes.
